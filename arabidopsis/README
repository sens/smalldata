Phenotype data from Ågren et. al. (2013) via John Lovell.  A set of
Arabidopsis recombinant inbred lines were derived from a cross of two
parents from Italy and Sweden.  They were grown in three years
(2009-2011) in Italy and Sweden.  The phenotype is the average number
of seeds per plant for each line which is a measure of fitness. We also
have the genotype data for the FLC (Flowering Time C) locus.

Column names:

- id: ID of RI line (first two are the parents)
- it09: Italy 2009
- it10: Italy 2010
- it11: Italy 2011
- sw09: Sweden 2009
- sw10: Sweden 2010
- sw11: Sweden 2011
- flc: Flowering time locus (C) genotype
