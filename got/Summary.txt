This dataset combines three sources of data, all of which are based on information from the book series.

Firstly, there is battles.csv which contains Chris Albon's "The War of the Five Kings" Dataset, which can be found here: https://github.com/chrisalbon/war_of_the_five_kings_dataset . Its a great collection of all of the battles in the series.

Secondly we have character-deaths.csv from Erin Pierce and Ben Kahle. This dataset was created as a part of their Bayesian Survival Analysis which can be found here: http://allendowney.blogspot.com/2015/03/bayesian-survival-analysis-for-game-of.html

Finally we have a more comprehensive character dataset with character-predictions.csv. This comes from the team at A Song of Ice and Data who scraped it from http://awoiaf.westeros.org/ . It also includes their predictions on which character will die, the methodology of which can be found here: https://got.show/machine-learning-algorithm-predicts-death-game-of-thrones
